A microemulsion is a thermodynamically stable, transparent, and isotropic mixture of oil, water, and surfactant, which can solubilize both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs. This unique characteristic enables microemulsions to enhance the bioavailability, solubility, and stability of drugs, leading to improved therapeutic efficacy and reduced side effects. Furthermore, microemulsions can be tailored to achieve controlled and targeted drug release, making them an attractive platform for the development of novel drug delivery systems. Overall, microemulsions have emerged as a promising technology to overcome the challenges associated with conventional drug delivery systems, and their potential applications are vast and diverse.</span>
